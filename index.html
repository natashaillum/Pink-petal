            <p>
              Mastectomy prosthesis foam is a specialized material used to
              create a natural, comfortable shape inside a post-mastectomy bra
              or swimsuit. The lightweight foam is designed to mimic the look
              and feel of a natural breast form for women who have undergone
              mastectomy surgery.

              The silicone gel and elastomer shell are formulated to mimic the

              Mastectomy supplies encompass a range of products used by women
              who have undergone mastectomy surgery for breast cancer treatment.
              Key mastectomy supplies include prostheses, bras, swimwear,
              sleeves, and wraps designed specifically for a post-operative
              chest.

          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Compression sleeves are an important mastectomy supply used by
              many breast cancer survivors. Compression sleeves are worn on the
              arms to help manage lymphedema, a common condition after lymph
              nodes are removed during mastectomy surgery.

          <button class="accordian">Camisoles Post Operative Care</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Mastectomy camisoles feature soft, breathable fabrics that do not
              irritate surgical scars and sensitive skin. They are designed with
              pockets or openings to accommodate drains during early stages of
              healing.

          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              In the days and weeks following mastectomy surgery, there are
              several important aspects of care to manage recovery. Bandages and
              drainage tubes need regular maintenance to prevent infection while
              also monitoring for complications. Pain management is critical,
              often involving medications and restricted arm mobility.
              Assistance may be required for daily tasks like getting dressed.
              Special post-surgical bras and prosthetics help protect and
              stabilize the chest.
